1. Configure the RewriteValve in server.xml

Edit the ~/conf/server.xml to add the below Valve inside the Host section as below –

...
      <Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps"
            unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">

        <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.rewrite.RewriteValve" />

...
      </Host>
...

2. Write the rewrite rule in rewrite.config

Create directory structure – ~/conf/Catalina/localhost/ and create the rewrite.config file inside it with the below content –

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_PATH} !-f
RewriteRule ^/(.*) /index.html

After setting this up restart the tomcat server and you can hit the deep links of the application which will route to the correct components inside the angular application.
