in my angular based app I'm using ct-flex components.
angular is 15.

in latter versions of Angular, there aren't support of flex component

migrate to standard implementation
you have an access to code via mcp server.

all code in /src
so DO NOT query like this:
`directoryToSearch`: `src`

use always absolute path for src, like this:
`directoryToSearch`: `/src`

start changing components one by one. show info message which current component in processing right now


continue migration until it will be done completely. the main objective is to change version of angular to ver 20

--------------
i need to check that mcp server is working correctly
issue and comment to read directories in /
only only, top, level
